Hello Agent, here is a short briefing about the game from us to get you started.

The game "SLAY THE DRAGON" has been revamped.

The backend game server is now built as a kernel module, and a game client is provided for you as a binary. 

In order to play the game, you must purchase the latest EMULATOR, qemu. This can be simply done with `sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86`.

Afterwards, simply navigate to the `run/` directory, and simply do `./run.sh` to run the game and get started!

You are now on your own. Best of luck, agent.
