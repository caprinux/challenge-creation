In 2021, PALINDROME released an RPG game that we believe was secretly disguised as a recruitment campaign for them to find capable members to join their organization.
Thankfully, with your help, we managed to defeat the game and sneak some undercover agents into PALINDROME.

However, in order for our agents to obtain crucial information about the organization and their upcoming plans, we must help the agents to rise up the ranks.

Except that this time there seems to be much more to it than just slaying the dragon?

The new version of the game seems to feature a few changes:
- Inventory System added
- Offline support added (server is now built locally into the kernel!)
- Code base revamped to be more secure (unreadable == difficult to understand == more secure)

Can you, once again, help us to dig deeper and uncover PALINDROME's upcoming plans? We are counting on you agent.
