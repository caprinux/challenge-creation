description: 'Buffer overflow is a simple vulnerability where a flaw in the program
  allows you to overflow an allocated buffer in memory.


  However, the tricky question is -- given a buffer overflow, what can we actually
  do with it?


  How can we go from a buffer overflow in the stack memory to getting remote code
  execution?


  p.s.


  For the best experience, you can test the challenge locally by running `bash run.sh`.


  You can attempt the challenge remotely as well by running `stty -icanon -echo ;
  nc challs.nusgreyhats.org 32831 ; stty sane`.
