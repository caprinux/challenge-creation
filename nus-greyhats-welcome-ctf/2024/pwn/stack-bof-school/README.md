# Challenge Name

Stack BOF School üçº

# Description

Buffer overflow is a simple vulnerability where a flaw in the program allows you to overflow an allocated buffer in memory.

However, the tricky question is -- given a buffer overflow, what can we actually do with it?

How can we go from a buffer overflow in the stack memory to getting remote code execution?

p.s.

For the best experience, you can test the challenge locally by running `bash run.sh`.

You can attempt the challenge remotely as well by running `stty -icanon -echo ; nc challs.nusgreyhats.org 32831 ; stty sane`.
