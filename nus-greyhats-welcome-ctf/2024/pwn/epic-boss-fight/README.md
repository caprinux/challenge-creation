# Description

Fundamentally, everything in memory is represented with simply `1`s and `0`s.

It might be easy to see how `1`s and `0`s can representing integers, since we can simply convert base-2 (binary) numbers to base-10 (decimal).

i.e. 1100 -> 12

However, have you ever wondered how we represent negative integers with simply `1`s and `0`s?
