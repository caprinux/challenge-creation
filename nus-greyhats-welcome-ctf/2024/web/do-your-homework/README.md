# Challenge Summary

reflected xss cookie stealing

# Details

My prof decided to come up with his own homework submission platform and submission is due on 23rd August 2359...

Yes, the submission due is past T\_T

Can you help me to find a way to hack into my professor's admin account?

_it seems like my submission is stored as pure HTML and the professor opens it almost immediately?_
