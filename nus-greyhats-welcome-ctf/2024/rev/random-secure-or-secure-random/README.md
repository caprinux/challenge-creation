# Challenge Name

random secure or secure random?

# Description

I wrote this program for fun to share my super secure password.

It encrypted with a super secure randomly generated stream of bytes :)

You can't get it right? I'm so confident that I even give the source.

_Unless `rand` isn't truly random?_
